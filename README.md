# CS330 Final Project – 3D Scene with OpenGL

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of the **CS330 – Computational Graphics and Visualization** course at Southern New Hampshire University.  
The goal was to design and implement a **fully interactive 3D scene** using C++ and OpenGL.  

The application demonstrates:
- Object-oriented design for reusable 3D objects  
- Application of transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)  
- Realistic rendering with **textures and lighting**  
- Camera navigation for user interaction

## 🎮 Features
- ✅ **Multiple 3D Models**: Laptop, Monitor, Water Bottle, Mug with Saucer, Headphones, and a Table Plane.  
- ✅ **Custom Classes** for modular object creation (`Mug.cpp`, `Laptop.cpp`, `Monitor.cpp`, etc.).  
- ✅ **Scene Management** using `SceneManager` for centralized rendering.  
- ✅ **Camera Controls** implemented through `ViewManager` for dynamic navigation.  
- ✅ **Lighting and Shading** with GLSL vertex and fragment shaders.  
- ✅ **Texture Mapping** for enhanced realism.
